# Housing Price Time Series Analysis

**Author**: Brian Lee

## Overview

For this project, you will use Time series modeling to analyze house sales in Houston, Texas. The descriptive analysis of the Zillow dataset show that certain zipcodes will have greater profits over time. The real estate agency can use this information to have a greater profit in selling homes to their customers, using their greater understanding in forecasted housing prices

## Business Problem

As multiple markets like the streaming and tech companies are interested in Texas due to relatively low house prices and no income tax. We have been hired by a real estate agency that is looking into investing into Houston, Texas early. This will allow for the company to better expect price jumps early, allowing for earlier buys at lower prices and selling at higher prices.

## The Data

This project uses the Zillow dataset, which can be found in  `zillow_data.csv` in the time-series folder in this repo.
